# markov-one-two
First and Second-order Markov model generation

- `firstOrderMarkov.py` - This script takes the top level comment and its immediate replies to create the transition matrix. The first order markov model is generated. Three graphs are generated for three different initial states. The output graph is stored in the Output folder as firstOrderMarkov.png 
- `secondOrderMarkov.py` - This script generated the second order transition matrix using three comments from the threads starting from the top level comment. The output is stored in the Output folder as a screenshot of the terminal with initial state, the transition matrix, and the end state.
